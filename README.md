# Overview

I am a software devloper always trying to further refine my skills and abilities in various programming languages. The following program was built to expand on my knowledge of JavaScript.

JavaScript progam for a ToDo list web application, utilizing recursion and external libraries. I built this program to practice and further refine my JavaScript abilities. The program allows users to add tasks for a todo list, check them off and delete them. The program saves the tasks to local storage and applies a unique ID using the UUID library to each task.
